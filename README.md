- ⚡ Fun fact:Honey never spoils!
-  Archaeologists have found pots
  of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs
  that are over 3,000 years old and still
  perfectly edible. This is because honey
  has low moisture content and high acidity,
  creating an environment that resists bacteria
  and spoilage. Sweet, right? 🍯
